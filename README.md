- 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Marcus, <a href="http://yourdigitalpastor.co">#YourDigitalPastor</a>!
- 🔜 I’m a former pastor embarking on a career change at age 40!
- 👨🏾‍💻 I’m currently enrolled in a cybersecurity certificate program at the University of Michigan and working toward a cybersecurity analyst position as soon as possible.
- 🧠 I’m really interested in network and cloud security, so I'm looking to learn as much as I can about how to apply Linux bash scripting and Python to my role in the industry. I also hope to create something of value in this space along the way
- 📫 You can reach me on every platform available @marcusacylar.
